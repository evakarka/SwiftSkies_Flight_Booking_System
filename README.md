Flight Boking System 

The SwiftSkies application provides a complete and functional system for both users and administrators. In this application, there can be an admin who will manage flights and view passengers, staff, flights, airplanes, and cities. The admin can also approve users who want to register as staff, pilots, and pursers. If someone wants to register as a regular user, they do not need admin approval. Users can search for flights and book the flight they desire. To complete the booking, the user must enter their details and pay by card, after which they will receive their ticket.
